# 100-Days-of-Code
Welcome to my Python learning journey crafted through Udemy's 100 Days of Code course by Dr. Angela Yu.

Here you can see my completed 30 out of 100 Python projects ranging from beginner to intermediate levels of difficulty. As the days progress, each project in this journey is progressively becoming more challenging.

This project has not only solidified my grasp of Python but has also familiarized me with the language in a way that I've grown to appreciate its simplicity and practicality. Overall, I've come to prefer Python over the other programming languages, with hopes to someday use it professionally.
So far, this journey has been a compelling mix of challenges and rewards, shaping my coding experience into something truly valuable.

In the projects I've covered a range of topics: Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Tkinter GUI, Files, Exceptions, Pandas and API Integrations, building a comprehensive foundation in my Python programming.
